description: Merge theoretical and empirical streams into unified patterns through guided synthesis

# Synthesis Command

This command guides you through integrating your theoretical stream (literature patterns) with your empirical stream (coded data patterns) into a unified analytical framework.

## Overview

Synthesis is where the magic of qualitative research happens. Your theoretical reading and empirical coding come together in a dialogue that produces understanding neither could achieve alone.

## Prerequisites

Before synthesis:
- [ ] Stream A (theoretical) has yielded patterns from foundational literature
- [ ] Stream B (empirical) has yielded patterns from coded documents
- [ ] Both streams are documented and accessible
- [ ] You've noticed some tensions or connections between streams

## The Synthesis Process

### Step 1: Map Stream Intersections

Identify where theoretical and empirical patterns:
- **Converge:** Theory predicted what you found
- **Diverge:** Data shows something theory didn't anticipate
- **Extend:** Data adds nuance to theoretical constructs
- **Challenge:** Findings contradict theoretical expectations

### Step 2: Navigate Tensions

When streams conflict, use **Lotus Wisdom** to:
- Transcend apparent contradictions
- Find higher-order integration
- Recognize that tension often signals important insight

Questions for tension navigation:
- What would it mean if both perspectives are partially right?
- What contextual factors might explain the divergence?
- Is the tension revealing limitations in existing theory?

### Step 3: Construct Integrated Patterns

Build patterns that honor both streams:

```
Integrated Pattern: [Name]
├── Theoretical grounding: [from literature]
├── Empirical evidence: [from your data]
├── Synthesis insight: [what integration reveals]
└── Remaining tensions: [what's unresolved]
```

### Step 4: Test Integration

For each integrated pattern, ask:
- Does this honor the complexity in my data?
- Does this engage meaningfully with theory?
- Would my informants recognize themselves?
- Does this advance theoretical understanding?

## Using @dialogical-coder for Synthesis

The @dialogical-coder agent can help with synthesis by:

1. **Presenting candidate patterns** from your coding
2. **Showing connections** to theoretical constructs
3. **Highlighting tensions** that need navigation
4. **Suggesting integration possibilities** for your consideration

Remember: You make the final interpretive decisions.

## Tools for Synthesis

- **Sequential Thinking:** Work through complex integration challenges step-by-step
- **Lotus Wisdom:** Navigate paradoxes and transcend either/or thinking
- **@dialogical-coder:** Assist with pattern presentation and connection mapping

## Common Synthesis Challenges

### Challenge: Theory Dominates Data
**Sign:** Your patterns read like literature review, not empirical insight
**Response:** Return to informant language; what are THEY saying?

### Challenge: Data Ignores Theory
**Sign:** Your patterns don't engage with scholarly conversation
**Response:** Ask "What would [theorist] say about this pattern?"

### Challenge: Too Many Patterns
**Sign:** You have 50+ patterns with no structure
**Response:** Use dimensional analysis; look for higher-order categories

### Challenge: Patterns Don't Cohere
**Sign:** Your framework feels like a list, not an argument
**Response:** What story are you telling? What's the theoretical contribution?

## Output: Your Synthesized Framework

After synthesis, you should have:
1. **Integrated patterns** that draw from both streams
2. **Clear theoretical engagement** with foundational literature
3. **Strong empirical grounding** in your data
4. **Documented tensions** that remain productive
5. **Emerging theoretical contribution** that advances understanding

## Next Steps

After synthesis:
1. Run `/qual-characterize-patterns` for dimensional analysis
2. Continue coding remaining documents using integrated patterns
3. Refine patterns as new data provides feedback
