Get guidance on how to build your foundational theoretical sensitivity through manual coding.

## Why Stage 1 Matters

Stage 1 is **not optional**. It's where you develop the interpretive depth that makes AI partnership meaningful.

Without Stage 1:
- AI becomes a coding calculator, not a partner
- You lose interpretive authority over patterns
- Framework lacks theoretical grounding
- No basis for evaluating AI suggestions

---

## What Stage 1 Requires

### Minimum Requirements
- **10-15 documents** coded manually
- **5+ analytical memos** capturing insights
- **Initial data structure** (concepts, themes)
- **Reflexivity entries** about your interpretive process

### Signs of Readiness
- Patterns are stabilizing (fewer new codes per document)
- You can articulate conceptual boundaries
- Memos show deepening theoretical thinking
- You have opinions about what matters in your data

---

## How to Do Stage 1

### 1. Select Your Documents
Choose diverse, information-rich cases:
- Different perspectives if applicable
- Varied contexts or situations
- Documents likely to challenge assumptions

### 2. Code Manually
For each document:
- Read carefully, multiple times
- Mark significant passages
- Develop codes from participant language (in-vivo)
- Write what you notice, not what you expect

### 3. Write Memos
After coding each document:
- What surprised you?
- What patterns are emerging?
- What tensions exist?
- What questions do you have?

Use `/qual-memo` to create structured memos.

### 4. Build Your Framework
Gradually organize codes into:
- **1st-order concepts** (participant language)
- **2nd-order themes** (your analytical abstraction)
- **Aggregate dimensions** (theoretical categories)

### 5. Reflect on Your Process
- What assumptions are you bringing?
- How is your position shaping what you see?
- What might you be missing?

## Getting Support

### Available During Stage 1

**@stage1-listener** - A curious thinking partner
- Helps you articulate what you're noticing
- Asks questions to deepen reflection
- Never suggests codes or patterns

**`/qual-think-through`** - For complex decisions
- Plan your coding approach
- Work through analytical challenges

**`/qual-memo`** - Capture insights
- Structured memo templates
- Links to concepts and quotes

### NOT Available Until Stage 1 Complete

- @dialogical-coder (AI-assisted coding)
- Batch processing
- Pattern synthesis tools

---

## Checking Your Progress

Run `/qual-status` to see:
- Documents coded
- Memos written
- Framework completeness
- Stage 1 readiness assessment

---

## When Stage 1 is Complete

When you're ready, run `/qual-complete-stage1` to:
1. Validate your foundation
2. Mark Stage 1 as complete
3. Unlock Stage 2 tools

**Only you can decide when you're ready** - the system checks minimums, but theoretical saturation is your judgment.

---

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I skip some documents?**
A: Code at least 10-15 diverse documents. Quality over quantity.

**Q: How long should Stage 1 take?**
A: Depends on data complexity. Days to weeks, not hours.

**Q: What if I'm stuck?**
A: Talk to @stage1-listener, write a memo, or step back and reflect.

**Q: Can I revisit Stage 1 later?**
A: Yes! You can always deepen your manual foundation.

## Philosophy

> "The goal is not to code quickly, but to develop theoretical sensitivity that makes you a capable partner for AI assistance."

Stage 1 is where you become the interpreter. Stage 2 is where AI helps you scale that interpretation.
