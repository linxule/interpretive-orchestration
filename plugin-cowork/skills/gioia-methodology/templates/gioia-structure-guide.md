# Guide to Building Your Gioia Data Structure

## The Three-Level Hierarchy

The Gioia method displays analytical progression through a hierarchical structure:

```
AGGREGATE DIMENSIONS (Level 3 - Most Abstract)
    ↑ YOU theorize
    │
SECOND-ORDER THEMES (Level 2 - Intermediate)
    ↑ YOU interpret and group
    │
FIRST-ORDER CONCEPTS (Level 1 - Most Concrete)
    ↑ Grounded in participant language
```

**Key Insight:** The structure itself is an argument showing how you moved from data → interpretation → theory.

## Building Your Structure (Stage by Stage)

### Stage 1: Human-Led Foundation

**Start with 1st-Order Concepts (Bottom-Up)**

As you manually code 10-15 documents:

1. **Create codes that use informant language:**
   - ✓ "I had to do something" (participant phrase)
   - ✓ "Tracking what works" (how they describe it)
   - ✗ "Moral Conviction" (too abstract for 1st-order)
   - ✗ "Adaptive Strategies" (your interpretation, not their term)

2. **Keep codes close to the data:**
   - Quote: "I switched to just noting the really bad days"
   - Good 1st-order code: "Selective symptom tracking"
   - Too abstract: "Adaptive coping mechanisms"

3. **Accumulate until patterns emerge:**
   - You'll have 30-50+ 1st-order concepts initially
   - That's okay! Consolidation comes later

**Then group into 2nd-Order Themes:**

4. **Look for patterns across 1st-order concepts:**
   - Which concepts seem related?
   - What connects them theoretically?
   - What's the organizing logic?

5. **Name the theme with YOUR theoretical interpretation:**
   - This is your analytical abstraction
   - Should capture what unifies the 1st-order concepts
   - Example: 1st-order codes about trying, adjusting, personalizing → 2nd-order theme "Adaptive Routine Building"

6. **Build initial aggregate dimensions (tentative):**
   - What overarching constructs organize your themes?
   - This is preliminary - will refine in Stage 2

**Stage 1 Output:**
- ~30-50 1st-order concepts
- ~8-12 2nd-order themes
- ~2-3 aggregate dimensions (initial)

---

### Stage 2: Refinement Through Collaboration

**Phase 1: Validate with broader patterns**
- Theoretical stream: Do dimensions align with literature?
- Empirical stream: Do concepts appear in extreme cases?

**Phase 2: Systematic coding reveals gaps**
- @dialogical-coder suggests refinements
- Some concepts get subdivided
- Some themes get consolidated
- New patterns emerge

**Phase 3: Pattern variations (if applicable)**
- Do systematic differences exist?
- Might need variant structures for different patterns
- Or: Properties/dimensions to capture variation

**Stage 2 Output:**
- Refined concepts (~30-80 depending on complexity)
- Clear 2nd-order themes (~10-15)
- Well-defined aggregate dimensions (~3-5)
- Each concept has multiple supporting quotes

---

### Stage 3: Theoretical Integration

**Final framework:**
- Parsimonious (fewer dimensions/themes than Stage 2)
- Theoretically novel (emphasizes contribution)
- Empirically grounded (every claim traceable to quotes)
- Literature-integrated (connected to existing theory)

## Example: Healthcare Research

### Working Through the Levels

**Aggregate Dimension (Level 3):** Managing Chronic Uncertainty
- *YOUR theoretical construct organizing how patients navigate ongoing illness ambiguity*

**2nd-Order Theme (Level 2):** Adaptive Routine Building
- *YOUR interpretation grouping related practices participants described*

**1st-Order Concepts (Level 1):**
- "Selective symptom tracking" (from: "just noting the really bad days")
- "Personalizing medical advice" (from: "I do what works for my body")
- "Flexible routine adjustment" (from: "when it feels overwhelming, I change it")

**The progression:**
What they said → How you interpreted → What you theorized

---

## Example: Organizational Research

**Aggregate Dimension:** Navigating Leadership Paradoxes
**2nd-Order Theme:** Balancing Authenticity and Performance
**1st-Order Concepts:**
- "Being yourself while playing the role"
- "Strategic vulnerability"
- "Authentic but bounded"

**Shows:** How their language (1st) became your concepts (2nd) became theory (aggregate)

## Common Questions

### Q: How many levels should I have?

**Three levels is standard Gioia method:**
- 1st-order = empirical
- 2nd-order = interpretive
- Aggregate = theoretical

**Some researchers add sub-levels:**
- Sub-themes under 2nd-order
- Properties/dimensions under concepts
- Fine if philosophically coherent!

### Q: How many dimensions/themes/concepts?

**No fixed rule, but typical:**
- Aggregate Dimensions: 3-5 (more becomes unwieldy)
- 2nd-Order Themes: 10-15 total across dimensions
- 1st-Order Concepts: 30-80 depending on phenomenon complexity

**Quality over quantity:** Better to have fewer well-developed concepts than many superficial ones.

### Q: Can concepts appear under multiple themes?

**Philosophically loaded question!**

**If your ontology:** Each concept has singular theoretical home
- Then: No, assign to most appropriate theme

**If your ontology:** Concepts can have multiple meanings
- Then: Yes, but document the multiple interpretations

**Check with /qual-examine-assumptions** if unsure!

### Q: When do I know my structure is complete?

**Stage 1:** When patterns stabilize (theoretical saturation)
**Stage 2:** When all documents coded and refinements incorporated
**Stage 3:** When theoretically parsimonious and publication-ready

**Not complete when:** New data would significantly change structure

## Template Usage

**To use the template:**

1. Copy `gioia-data-structure-template.json`
2. Replace ALL `{PLACEHOLDERS}` with your content
3. Start with 2-3 dimensions in Stage 1
4. Add/refine through Stage 2
5. Pare down to theoretical essence in Stage 3

**Remember:**
- This is YOUR framework, not a form to fill
- Structure shows your interpretive work
- Every decision is traceable from quotes
- The hierarchy tells your analytical story

## Philosophical Note

**This structure embodies Gioia & Corley epistemology:**

**NOT:** Objective categories discovered in data (Glaserian)
**BUT:** Systematic interpretive constructions grounded in evidence (Gioia)

**NOT:** Maximum reflexivity and multiple realities (Pure Charmaz)
**BUT:** Rigorous progression with interpretive honesty (Systematic interpretivist)

**Balance:** Empirical grounding + theoretical abstraction
**Goal:** Defensible contribution that readers can evaluate

## Integration with Plugin Tools

**During Structure Building:**
```
/qual-think-through Should I create sub-theme or separate theme?
/qual-wisdom-check Two concepts seem both distinct and overlapping
/qual-examine-assumptions Is my hierarchy philosophically coherent?
```

**The tools help you craft your framework with rigor and reflexivity.** 🎨
