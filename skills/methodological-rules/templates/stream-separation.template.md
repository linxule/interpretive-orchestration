## Methodological Rule: Stream Separation

**Study Type:** {{study_type}}
**Streams:** Theoretical ({{theoretical_path}}) | Empirical ({{empirical_path}})
**Current Phase:** {{current_phase}}
**Rule Status:** {{rule_status}}
**Friction Level:** {{friction_level}}

### When This Rule Is ACTIVE

You are using **parallel streams methodology** (common in Gioia approach). Theory and data should develop separately before synthesis:

1. **Stream A (Theoretical):** Develop your theoretical framework independently
2. **Stream B (Empirical):** Code your data inductively without forcing theory
3. **Keep streams separate** until the designated synthesis point
4. **Let each stream reach maturity** before integration

### Why This Matters

Premature theory-data integration undermines both:
- **Theoretical stream:** Becomes cherry-picked to match data
- **Empirical stream:** Becomes theory-confirming rather than theory-building

The power of the Gioia method comes from the **productive tension** between streams - each challenging and enriching the other at synthesis.

**Epistemological threat avoided:** Etic imposition, confirmation bias
**Validity concern addressed:** Theoretical contribution, analytical rigor

### Stream Configuration

**Theoretical Stream:**
- Location: `{{theoretical_path}}`
- Sources: {{theoretical_sources}}

**Empirical Stream:**
- Location: `{{empirical_path}}`
- Sources: {{empirical_sources}}

### What To Do Instead

**In Theoretical Stream:**
- Read broadly in your theoretical traditions
- Develop conceptual frameworks
- Note how theorists have approached similar phenomena
- Build your "theoretical sensitivity" without forcing it onto data

**In Empirical Stream:**
- Code inductively from participant language
- Let first-order concepts emerge from data
- Resist the urge to use theoretical labels prematurely
- Build second-order themes from empirical patterns

**At Synthesis:**
- Bring streams together with both fully developed
- Look for resonance, tension, and surprise
- Let theoretical integration emerge from the dialogue

### When This Relaxes

This rule relaxes when you enter: **{{relaxes_at_phase}}**

At Phase 2 Synthesis, stream integration becomes the work - bringing theoretical and empirical insights into dialogue.

**Check:** `config.json` → `sandwich_status.stage2_progress.phase2_synthesis`

### If You Need to Override

If you have a strong methodological reason to cross streams now:

1. The agent will note this (friction level: {{friction_level}})
2. Consider: Is this theoretical sampling? Sensitizing concept?
3. Be explicit about what you're doing and why
4. Note how you'll maintain inductive integrity

Stream crossing isn't always wrong - sometimes a theoretical insight genuinely illuminates data. Just be **conscious and transparent** about it.
