# paradox-navigation

Navigate apparent contradictions and integrate tensions using contemplative reasoning. Invokes Lotus Wisdom MCP with qualitative research framing.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Patterns seem contradictory but both feel true
- User is stuck in either/or thinking
- Theoretical and empirical streams seem irreconcilable
- User mentions "paradox", "tension", "contradiction", "both/and"
- Pattern characterizations overlap in confusing ways
- Integration feels impossible

## MCP Used

**Lotus Wisdom** (bundled, no API key required)

## How It Works

Lotus Wisdom applies contemplative problem-solving through five domains:

### 1. Skillful Means (Upaya)
Different approaches to truth - sometimes direct, sometimes gradual.

### 2. Non-Dual Recognition
Seeing how apparent opposites can be integrated at a higher level.

### 3. Meta-Cognitive
The mind watching its own understanding - reflexivity in action.

### 4. Process Flow
Natural arcs of inquiry - open, engage, express, complete.

### 5. Meditation
Pauses to let insights emerge from stillness.

## When to Invoke

### Stage 1
- When emergent themes seem contradictory
- "Participants say X but also Y..."

### Stage 2 Phase 2
- Navigating tensions between theoretical and empirical patterns
- "The literature says... but my data shows..."

### Stage 2 Phase 3
- When patterns overlap in confusing ways
- "These two themes seem both distinct and the same..."

### Stage 3
- Integrating diverse findings into coherent theory
- Moving from tension to theoretical contribution

## Invocation Pattern

```
Use Lotus Wisdom to navigate this tension:

Apparent Contradiction:
- On one hand: [First perspective]
- On the other hand: [Second perspective]

Context:
- Research question: [from config]
- Why this matters: [stakes of resolution]

Help me see if there's a higher integration or if the tension itself
is meaningful for my theorizing.
```

## Example Prompts

### Pattern Overlap
```
Help me navigate this tension in my data:

Pattern A: Participants describe wanting more autonomy
Pattern B: Same participants describe wanting more guidance

Is this a contradiction? A paradox? Something else?
What might integration look like?
```

### Theory-Data Tension
```
Navigate this tension:

Theoretical expectation: Sensemaking is retrospective (Weick)
Empirical finding: Participants describe prospective sensemaking

Is my data challenging theory, or am I misunderstanding something?
```

### Concept Boundaries
```
Two concepts seem to overlap:
- "Selective symptom tracking"
- "Personalizing medical advice"

Are these the same thing? Different aspects? A continuum?
Help me see what I might be missing.
```

## Output Characteristics

Lotus Wisdom produces:
- Beautiful visualizations with symbols
- Multiple perspective integration
- Meditation pauses for reflection
- Recognition of non-dual possibilities

Sample output structure:
```
Opening: Recognizing the apparent contradiction
Engage: Examining each side deeply
Transform: Seeking the higher integration
Integrate: What holds both truths
Embody: How this changes your understanding
```

## Philosophical Alignment

Lotus Wisdom is particularly appropriate for:
- **Constructivist research** - Multiple realities coexist
- **Interpretivist work** - Tensions can be productive
- **Theory building** - Paradox often signals theoretical opportunity

The tool doesn't resolve tensions by choosing sides - it helps you see how both can be true at different levels of analysis.

## Integration Notes

- **Complements Sequential Thinking** - ST for step-by-step, LW for paradox
- **Supports reflexivity** - Makes your interpretive stance explicit
- **Preserves complexity** - Doesn't flatten nuance
