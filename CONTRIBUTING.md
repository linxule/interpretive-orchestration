# Contributing to Interpretive Orchestration

Welcome! We're building epistemic partnership infrastructure together. 🌟

---

## 🤝 Our Philosophy of Collaboration

This isn't just code - it's **epistemology operationalized**.

Every contribution should:
- Maintain philosophical coherence
- Deepen epistemic partnership
- Respect context-agnostic design
- Teach, not just enable

**We value thoughtful contributions over quick PRs.**

---

## Before Contributing

### 1. Understand Our Philosophical Stance

Read these first:
- `README.md` - Philosophy-first introduction
- [https://www.threadcounts.org/p/loom-xv-theorizing-by-building](https://www.threadcounts.org/p/loom-xv-theorizing-by-building-018) - Our learning process
- `skills/project-setup/templates/epistemic-stance.md` - Philosophical foundations

**Key commitments:**
- Gioia/Constructivist interpretivist (default, configurable)
- Human interpretive authority (non-negotiable)
- Sandwich methodology (human → human-AI → human)
- Meta-cognition embedded everywhere
- Transformation over automation

### 2. Check Epistemic Coherence

**Ask yourself:**
- Does my contribution maintain internal philosophical consistency?
- Am I using language aligned with constructivism? (construct, interpret, characterize)
- Does this deepen epistemic partnership or enable calculator mindset?
- Am I preserving human interpretive authority?

**Use `/qual-examine-assumptions` on your own contribution!**

### 3. Respect Context-Agnosticism

**Good:**
- Generic structures with {PLACEHOLDERS}
- Examples from multiple domains
- Transferable processes

**Avoid:**
- Hard-coding specific research contexts
- Examples that over-determine usage
- Domain assumptions embedded invisibly

## Types of Contributions We Welcome

### 1. Bug Fixes & Improvements
- Philosophical incoherence found
- Broken command links
- Unclear documentation
- Technical errors

**Process:**
1. Open issue describing problem
2. Include philosophical rationale if relevant
3. Submit PR with fix
4. Explain how fix maintains coherence

### 2. New Commands
**Before building, ask:**
- Does this serve epistemic partnership?
- Is it transformative, not just productive?
- Does it maintain human interpretive authority?
- Where does it fit in sandwich stages?

**Required in PR:**
- Epistemology section in command file
- Context-agnostic examples
- When/why to use guidance
- Integration with existing tools

### 3. New Agents
**Agents must:**
- Show visible reasoning
- Express genuine uncertainty
- Ask questions that deepen human reflexivity
- Adapt to researcher's philosophical stance (read config.json)
- Defer to human interpretive authority

**Follow @dialogical-coder as exemplar.**

### 4. Additional GT Traditions
**Want to add Straussian? Phenomenology? Discourse analysis?**

Excellent! But:
- Must be internally coherent (own ontology, epistemology, methodology)
- Should not mix with incompatible traditions
- Needs separate configuration option
- Requires documentation of philosophical commitments

**We welcome philosophical diversity, not philosophical confusion.**

### 5. MCP Integrations
**Proposing new MCP to bundle?**

Great! Show us:
- What epistemic function does it serve?
- When in sandwich journey should it activate?
- How does it deepen partnership vs enable automation?
- Usage guidance for researchers

**MCPs are epistemic tools, not just utilities.**

### 6. Documentation Improvements
**Always welcome:**
- Clearer explanations
- More domain examples
- Better analogies
- Philosophical clarity
- Pedagogical refinements

### 7. Translation & Accessibility
- Other languages
- Different learning styles
- Accessibility improvements
- Cultural adaptations (maintaining epistemology)

## Contribution Process

### 1. Discuss First (For Major Changes)
Open an issue before building:
- Describe what you want to add
- Explain philosophical rationale
- Discuss coherence with maintainers

**We'll explore together:** Does this fit? How to integrate?

### 2. Fork & Develop
- Fork repository
- Create feature branch
- Build with care (like a maestro!)
- Test with your own research or examples

### 3. Document Reflexively
**Include in PR:**
- What you built
- WHY you built it (philosophical rationale)
- How it maintains coherence
- What you learned building it

**Reflexive documentation expected!**

### 4. Submit PR
**PR should include:**
- Clear description
- Philosophical coherence check
- Examples (context-agnostic)
- Documentation updates
- Your reflexive notes

### 5. Dialogue & Refinement
- We'll engage thoughtfully
- May ask philosophical questions
- Might suggest refinements
- Goal: Integration that strengthens whole

**This is collaborative, not gatekeeping.**

- Clear documentation
- Thoughtful integration
- Maestro-level attention

### ✅ Reflexive Awareness
- Contributor examined their own assumptions
- Documentation shows learning process
- Alternatives considered
- Limitations acknowledged

## What We're Cautious About

### ⚠️ Automation Features
**If your contribution automates:**
- Does it bypass necessary human engagement?
- Does it create calculator mindset risk?
- Could it work WITHOUT human theoretical foundation?

**We might ask:** How to make this collaborative, not automatic?

### ⚠️ Philosophical Mixing
**If your contribution mixes traditions:**
- Is the hybrid internally coherent?
- Or does it mix incompatible ontologies?

**We'll discuss:** How to maintain coherence while enabling flexibility?

### ⚠️ Feature Creep
**If your contribution adds complexity:**
- Does it serve transformation purpose?
- Or is it "nice to have" feature?

**Our standard:** Every addition must justify its epistemic value.

## Community Norms

### 1. Thoughtful Over Quick
- Take time with contributions
- Think through implications
- Refine before submitting

### 2. Dialogue Over Critique
- We discuss, not dismiss
- We question to understand
- We refine together

### 3. Learning Over Perfection

### 4. Coherence Over Completeness
- Better to have fewer coherent pieces
- Than many philosophically confused features
- Quality, not quantity

### 5. Community Over Individual
- How does this help collective knowledge?
- Can others build on this?
- Does it strengthen the whole?
