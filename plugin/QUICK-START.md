## The Three Stages

| Stage | You Do | Tools Available |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **Stage 1: Solo Practice** | Manual coding, memos | @stage1-listener, /qual-think-through |
| **Stage 2: Collaboration** | Guide AI, refine patterns | @dialogical-coder, @research-configurator |
| **Stage 3: Dialogue** | Interpret significance | @scholarly-companion |

## Key Commands

### Project Setup
```bash
/qual-init                # Start: Socratic onboarding
/qual-status              # Check: Where am I in the journey?
/qual-check-setup         # Verify: Is everything configured?
/qual-configure-analysis  # Setup: Model and batch configuration
```

### Stage 1 (Solo Practice)
```bash
/qual-memo                # Write: Analytical memo from coding
```

### Stage 2 (Collaboration)
```bash
/qual-parallel-streams       # Run: Theoretical + empirical streams
/qual-code-deductive         # Code: Apply framework to documents
/qual-characterize-patterns  # Analyze: Systematic variation
/qual-synthesize             # Merge: Integrate streams
```

### Analysis & Reflection
```bash
/qual-think-through       # Deep: Structured reasoning (Sequential Thinking)
/qual-wisdom-check        # Navigate: Paradox integration (Lotus Wisdom)
/qual-examine-assumptions # Meta: Check philosophical coherence
/qual-reflect             # Synthesize: End-of-session dialogue
```

## Key Agents

| Agent | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `@stage1-listener` | Stage 1 - thinking partner for manual coding |
| `@dialogical-coder` | Stage 2 - 4-stage reflexive coding |
| `@research-configurator` | Stage 2 - "The Whisperer" (12 capabilities: model selection, cost estimation, batch strategy, API setup - all without coding!) |
| `@scholarly-companion` | Stage 3 - theoretical dialogue |

## Skills (Auto-Discovered)

Claude loads these when relevant to your request:

| Say This | Skill Loads |
|----------|-------------|
| "initialize", "new project" | `project-setup` |
| "data structure", "Gioia" | `gioia-methodology` |
| "literature", "Stream A" | `literature-sweep` |
| "transcribe", "convert" | `interview-ingest` |
| "think through", "plan" | `deep-reasoning` |
| "tension", "both/and" | `paradox-navigation` |

## Bundled MCPs (No API Keys)

- **Sequential Thinking** - Structured reasoning chains
- **Lotus Wisdom** - Navigate paradoxes, integrate tensions
- **Markdownify** - Convert PDFs, transcribe audio, extract from videos

**Optional (with API keys):** MinerU (90%+ PDF accuracy), Zen (multi-model), Exa (search), Jina (fetch), Zotero (bibliography). See [DEPENDENCIES.md](DEPENDENCIES.md).
