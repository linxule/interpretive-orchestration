  "description": "Atelier of Co-Apprenticeship for interpretive qualitative research. Human and AI learn together as apprentices to the craft tradition (rigor, reflexivity, theoretical sensitivity). Three stages: Solo Practice → Side-by-Side Collaboration → Dialogue with Tradition. Instantiates Partnership Agency from Cognitio Emergens framework. Prevents calculator mindset, embeds meta-cognition, maintains human interpretive authority. Built with care on Gioia/Constructivist principles.",
