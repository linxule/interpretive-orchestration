# Examples Directory

## What Will Live Here

**Future content:**
- Tutorial example project (simplified for learning)
- Possibilistic narratives example (the research that inspired this plugin)
- Healthcare research example (chronic illness self-care)
- Educational research example (learning strategies)
- Organizational research example (leadership practices)

**Each example will show:**
- Complete project structure
- Sample documents
- Evolving data structure across stages
- Conversation logs
- Reflexive journal entries
- **How the generic plugin structure works with specific content**

---

## Why Examples Matter

### For Learning
- Concrete demonstrations of abstract processes
- See how {PLACEHOLDERS} get filled
- Understand context-agnostic design in practice

### For Validation
- Plugin works across all qualitative research domains
- Gioia structure adapts to different phenomena
- Same process, different content

### For Inspiration
- Possibilities for your own research
- Different analytical challenges solved
- Various ways to use epistemic tools

## The Vision

**Eventually:**
Researchers opening this folder find examples from THEIR domain, seeing that:
- "Oh! Someone used this for healthcare research - it really is transferable!"
- "The same structure works for completely different phenomena!"
- "I can see my own project taking shape similarly!"

**For now:**
This placeholder signals future growth while keeping MVEP focused and complete.

*Examples will come. For now, the infrastructure is ready.* 🌱
