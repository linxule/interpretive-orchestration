# Parallel Streams Analysis

This command guides you through the dual-stream approach from the Atelier methodology, where theoretical patterns from literature and empirical patterns from your data develop in parallel before synthesis.

## Overview

In Stage 2, Phase 1, you work with two streams simultaneously:

- **Stream A (Theoretical):** Extract patterns from foundational literature
- **Stream B (Empirical):** Extract patterns from your coded documents

These streams develop independently before synthesis, allowing genuine dialogue between theory and data.

## Stream A: Theoretical Pattern Extraction

### Purpose
Systematically extract theoretical patterns from your foundational literature that may inform your empirical analysis.

### Process
1. **Identify foundational articles** (3-5 key papers)
2. **Extract theoretical constructs** and their relationships
3. **Note the philosophical commitments** of each framework
4. **Document how constructs are operationalized** in the literature

### Questions to Guide Stream A
- What theoretical patterns emerge from the literature?
- How do different authors conceptualize your phenomenon?
- What dimensions or variations does the literature suggest?
- Where do theoretical frameworks converge or diverge?

### Tools
- Use **Markdownify** to convert PDF articles to analyzable text
- Use **Sequential Thinking** to work through complex theoretical frameworks
- Optional: **Exa/Jina** for literature search and fetching

## Stream B: Empirical Pattern Extraction

### Purpose
Continue building patterns from your coded documents, now with AI assistance through @dialogical-coder.

### Process
1. **Review your Stage 1 codes** and initial framework
2. **Code additional documents** using @dialogical-coder
3. **Track emergent patterns** that weren't in your initial framework
4. **Note variations and exceptions** that challenge existing categories

### Questions to Guide Stream B
- What patterns are you seeing across documents?
- How do patterns vary by context, participant, or situation?
- What surprises you or challenges your initial framework?
- Where do informants' language and concepts differ from literature?

### Tools
- **@dialogical-coder** for 4-stage reflexive coding
- **Sequential Thinking** for working through complex coding decisions
- **Lotus Wisdom** when patterns seem contradictory

## Tracking Your Streams

Create a tracking document or use your project notes to maintain:

```
Stream A (Theoretical)
----------------------
Article: [Title]
Key constructs: [list]
Relationships: [describe]
Philosophical stance: [note]

Stream B (Empirical)
--------------------
Documents coded: [X of Y]
Emergent patterns: [list]
Surprises/challenges: [describe]
```

## When to Move to Synthesis

You're ready for synthesis (/qual-synthesize) when:
- You've processed your foundational literature
- You've coded a substantial portion of your documents
- Both streams have generated distinct patterns
- You notice tensions or connections between streams

## Philosophical Note

Parallel streams prevent two common errors:
1. **Forcing data into theory** (deductive imperialism)
2. **Ignoring relevant theory** (naive inductivism)

The dialogue between streams creates the interplay central to Gioia methodology.

## Next Steps

After working with parallel streams:
1. Document patterns from both streams
2. Note initial connections and tensions
3. Run `/qual-synthesize` to integrate streams
