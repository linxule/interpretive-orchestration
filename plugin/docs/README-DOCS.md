## The Meta-Research Story

**These docs tell the story of:**
- Using AI to build AI-research infrastructure
- Philosophical coherence as design challenge
- Tool-building as methods scholarship
- Reflexive documentation as research practice

**The building process IS the contribution.**

**The documentation captures the epistemic journey.**

---

## Documentation Philosophy

**Not just "how to use":**
- But "why it works this way"
- And "what we learned building it"
- And "how you can think with it"

**Documentation as pedagogy:**
- Teaching epistemology through examples
- Showing reflexive practice through our process
- Modeling what we ask of users

**Welcome to the documentation. Philosophy first, features second.** 🌟
