## Known Limitations of MVP

1. **Parallel Streams:** Stage 2 theoretical and empirical streams are sequential, not truly parallel
2. **Chinese Localization:** Interface is English only (framework supports future localization)
3. **Drift Detection:** Epistemic coherence is checked via friction, not automated drift detection
4. **Performance:** Benchmarked but not optimized for extreme scale (1000+ documents)

---

## Success Criteria

The MVP is considered successful when:

1. ✅ All P0 requirements implemented
2. ✅ All philosophical non-negotiables met
3. ✅ All tests passing
4. ✅ Example project demonstrates workflow
5. ✅ Documentation is comprehensive
6. ✅ Researchers can complete full 3-stage analysis
