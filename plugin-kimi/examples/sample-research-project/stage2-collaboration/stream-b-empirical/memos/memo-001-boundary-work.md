# Analytic Memo 001: Boundary Work in Remote Transitions

**Date:** April 5, 2024
**Memo by:** Researcher
**Documents reviewed:** P001 (Alex), P002 (Sam), P003 (Jordan)
**Theme:** Boundary work and spatial identity

---

## Summary

Across the first three interviews, a strong pattern emerges around what I'm calling "boundary work"—the active practices engineers develop to separate and integrate work and personal identities when both occur in the same physical space.

---

## Key Observations

### 1. The Office as Identity Anchor

Alex: "My office was my identity... When I walked into TechCorp's building, I was 'Alex the senior engineer.'"
Sam: "The commute was my transition ritual. Without it, I didn't know how to become 'work Sam.'"
Jordan: "I miss the elevator, honestly. That 30-second ride was when I mentally switched modes."

**Interpretation:** The physical office served as a liminal space for identity transition. Without it, workers struggle with "who am I right now?"

### 2. Constructed Boundaries

All three participants have developed deliberate practices:

| Participant | Boundary Practice |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Alex | Work clothes, dedicated desk in bedroom corner |
| Sam | Morning walk around the block ("fake commute"), separate laptop for work |
| Jordan | Room divider to create "office zone" in studio apartment |

**Interpretation:** Boundary work is **active and intentional**, not natural or automatic. These aren't just preferences—they're necessary identity management practices.

### 3. Boundary Permeability Variations

Different boundary strategies suggest different philosophical approaches:

- **Alex (segmenting):** "When I'm there, I'm working. When I leave, I'm home."
- **Sam (integrating):** "I like that I can throw in a load of laundry during the day."
- **Jordan (struggling):** "I check Slack at 10 PM without thinking. It's a problem."

**Interpretation:** Boundary strategies vary in permeability. Some seek strict separation (segmenters), others embrace integration (integrators), some struggle with both (conflicted).

### 4. Boundary Failures

Jordan's experience shows boundary breakdown:

> "My bed is six feet from my desk. Sometimes I'll be watching Netflix at 11 PM and see a Slack notification and just... respond. Then I'm working at 11 PM in bed. That's not healthy."

**Interpretation:** Inadequate boundary construction leads to identity confusion and burnout risk.

## Emerging Concepts

**1. Identity Liminality**
The state of being "between" identities—no longer clearly "at work" or "at home." Creates uncertainty about appropriate behavior.

**2. Performative Presence**
The need to actively demonstrate work-ness in the absence of physical presence. Includes status updates, camera-on culture, responsiveness signaling.

**3. Boundary Infrastructure**
The physical and behavioral tools people construct to manage spatial identity: dedicated desks, clothing rituals, time-based transitions.

**4. Osmosis Disruption**
The loss of ambient, unstructured learning that occurred in physical office spaces. Requires intentional replacement strategies.

## Questions for Further Analysis

1. **Are boundary strategies stable over time?** Alex mentioned it took "six months" to develop his desk ritual. Do strategies evolve?

2. **What enables successful boundary construction?** Space? Resources? Personality? Organizational support?

3. **How do organizations impact boundary work?** Some mandate camera-on, others don't. Some respect off-hours, others don't.

4. **Is boundary work gendered?** Anecdotally, female participants mentioned childcare interruptions more. Worth exploring.

## Connections to Literature

**Nippert-Eng (1996):** Boundary work as "calendaring, accounting, and tidying." Our participants show similar practices but for identity rather than just time.

**Kreiner et al. (2009):** "Work-home boundary theory" identifies segmenters vs. integrators. Our data shows a third category: "strugglers" who want to segment but can't.

**Ashforth et al. (2000):** Identity transitions require "boundary crossing." Our participants lost the physical boundary and must construct psychological/behavioral substitutes.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Code 3 more documents specifically for boundary-related content
- [ ] Look for "successful" vs. "struggling" boundary workers
- [ ] Interview question: "Walk me through your typical workday start"
- [ ] Consider theoretical dimension: "Managing Identity Boundaries"
