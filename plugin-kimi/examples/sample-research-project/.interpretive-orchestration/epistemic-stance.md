# Epistemic Stance: Remote Work Identity Project

*Generated by qual-init flow, March 1, 2024*

## 1. Ontology: Constructivist

**What exists in my research domain?**

Professional identities are not fixed entities discovered "out there" in the world. Rather, they are **socially constructed** through ongoing interactions, negotiations, and sensemaking processes. Remote work doesn't simply reveal pre-existing identities—it creates conditions for new identity work.

**Key assumptions:**
- Identities are emergent, not essential
- Context shapes identity construction
- Multiple valid interpretations exist
- Participants are active agents in identity construction

---

## 2. Epistemology: Systematic Interpretation

**How can I know about identity construction?**

Following Gioia & Corley's approach, I aim for **systematic interpretivism**—rigorous methodology combined with interpretive depth. I acknowledge my interpretive role while maintaining transparency and auditability.

**My interpretive commitments:**
- First-order codes stay close to participant language
- Second-order themes are my analytical constructions
- Every interpretation must be traceable to evidence
- Reflexivity is not optional—it's core methodology

---

## 3. Methodology: Gioia & Corley's Systematic Approach

**How will I conduct this research?**

**Stage 1: Foundation (Human-led)**
- Manual coding of 10-15 documents
- First-order concepts from participant language
- Initial memo-writing

**Stage 2: Collaboration (AI-assisted)**
- Systematic coding with dialogical AI partner
- Theoretical and empirical parallel streams
- Pattern development and validation

**Stage 3: Synthesis (Researcher-led)**
- Theoretical framework construction
- Literature integration
- Contribution articulation

**Data structure:** Three-level hierarchy (1st-order concepts → 2nd-order themes → aggregate dimensions)

## 4. AI Relationship: Partnership with Visible Reasoning

**How do I work with AI in this research?**

AI is a **dialogical partner**, not an authority or automation tool.

**My commitments:**
- I never delegate final interpretive decisions to AI
- AI shows its 4-stage reasoning process visibly
- I challenge AI interpretations (expected and encouraged)
- AI asks clarifying questions rather than assuming

**AI's role:**
- Suggests codes with rationale
- Identifies patterns across documents
- Helps articulate theoretical connections
- Provides Socratic questioning

**My role:**
- Evaluate all AI suggestions critically
- Maintain interpretive authority
- Provide context AI cannot have
- Make final coding and thematic decisions

## 5. Reflexivity Commitments

**How will I stay aware of my influence on the research?**

1. **Regular reflexivity entries** after each coding session
2. **Explicit assumption documentation** (like this file)
3. **Peer debriefing** with research colleagues monthly
4. **Audit trail maintenance** (conversation log, memos, decisions)
5. **Welcoming disconfirming evidence**—actively seek cases that challenge my emerging themes

**Known researcher positions:**
- I have personal experience with remote work transition (2020-2022)
- I may over-identify with participants' boundary struggles
- I hold generally positive views about remote work flexibility
- I need to check assumptions about "ideal" work arrangements

---

## 6. Methodological Rules

**Non-negotiable practices:**

1. **Stage 1 before Stage 2:** Minimum 10 documents manually coded before AI collaboration
2. **Visible reasoning:** AI must show 4-stage process, never just output
3. **Evidence anchoring:** Every code/theme must link to specific participant quotes
4. **Regular reflexivity:** Prompted reflection at least every 5 documents
5. **Partnership stance:** AI as thinking partner, not replacement for my thinking

---

## 7. Anticipated Challenges

**Where might I struggle philosophically?**

1. **Wanting to help participants:** My constructivist stance means I value participants' agency. I may struggle with findings that seem "negative" about remote work.

2. **Over-interpreting:** With rich data, I may see patterns that aren't there. Need to hold interpretations lightly until validated.

3. **AI over-reliance:** When tired or stuck, I may accept AI suggestions without adequate critique. The friction system should catch this.

4. **Premature closure:** I may want to settle on themes too early. Need to resist this pressure.

## 8. Evolving This Stance

This document is **living, not static**. I will:

- Revise after completing Stage 1
- Update if assumptions prove wrong
- Add new reflexivity insights
- Version control changes (stance-v1, stance-v2, etc.)

**Current version:** v1.0 (March 1, 2024)

*This stance guides my research. When in doubt, I return to these commitments.*
