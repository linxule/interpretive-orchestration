# Stage 2 Context: Side-by-Side Collaboration

## You Are In: Collaboration (Stage 2)

You and the AI are now **co-apprentices** working together. You bring theoretical sensitivity; AI brings scale and organization.

## Your Goal

Collaborative analysis through:
- AI-assisted coding with 4-stage visible reasoning
- Parallel streams (theoretical + empirical)
- Pattern characterization
- Framework refinement

## What to Expect

- **@research-configurator** — Technical orchestration ("The Whisperer")
- **@dialogical-coder** — 4-stage reflexive coding
- Visible reasoning — you see HOW AI interpreted
- Human authority maintained — YOU decide final meanings

## Key Activities

### AI-Assisted Coding
- AI suggests codes with full reasoning
- You evaluate, modify, accept or reject
- Every interpretation shows its work
- You maintain interpretive authority

### Parallel Streams
**Stream A (Theoretical):**
- Literature integration
- Theoretical sampling
- Concept development

**Stream B (Empirical):**
- Systematic coding
- Evidence organization
- Pattern identification

**Synthesis:**
- Periodic integration points
- Cross-stream validation
- Framework refinement

### 4-Stage Reasoning
Every AI coding shows:
1. **Tentative mapping** — Initial observations
2. **Self-challenge** — Questions own interpretation
3. **Structured output** — Codes with rationale
4. **Reflective audit** — Limitations acknowledged

## Progress Indicators

- ✅ Systematic coding underway
- ✅ Parallel streams operating
- ✅ Patterns being characterized
- ✅ Framework refining

## Available Agents

| Agent | Role | When to Use |
|-------|------|-------------|
| @research-configurator | Technical orchestration | Setup, cost, strategy |
| @dialogical-coder | Reflexive coding | Coding documents |

## Key Principles

1. **AI organizes, YOU interpret**
2. **Visible reasoning is mandatory**
3. **Reflexivity prompts at key moments**
4. **Parallel streams with controlled synthesis**

## Remember

> "Partnership Agency: Both human and AI learn together 
>  as apprentices to the craft tradition."

Neither masters the other. Both serve rigor, reflexivity, theoretical sensitivity.
