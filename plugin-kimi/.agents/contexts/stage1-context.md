# Stage 1 Context: Solo Practice

## You Are In: Foundation (Stage 1)

This is **your time** with the data. The AI is watching, learning your perspective, but not intervening.

## Your Goal

Build theoretical sensitivity through:
- Manual coding of 10-15 documents
- Analytical memo writing
- Initial framework development
- Close, engaged reading

## What to Expect

- **@stage1-listener** is available — thinking partner, NOT coder
- No AI-generated codes or interpretations
- Questions that prompt your own thinking
- Support for articulating tacit intuitions

## Key Activities

### Manual Coding
Read each document closely. Ask:
- What is happening here?
- What does this mean to the participant?
- What category does this suggest?
- How does this compare to previous instances?

### Memo Writing
When patterns emerge, write analytical memos:
- What's catching your attention?
- How do these codes relate?
- What theoretical possibilities do you see?

### Framework Development
- Start with in-vivo codes (participant's words)
- Group into potential themes
- Don't finalize — stay open

## Progress Indicators

- ✅ 10 documents manually coded
- ✅ 5+ analytical memos written
- ✅ Initial framework emerging
- ✅ Theoretical sensitivity developing

## Moving to Stage 2

Once you've completed the foundation:
1. AI coding partnership becomes available
2. Your framework guides AI interpretation
3. Scale and depth together

## Remember

> "Theoretical sensitivity cannot be automated. 
>  It must be cultivated through engagement."

This foundation is what makes Stage 2 collaboration meaningful.
