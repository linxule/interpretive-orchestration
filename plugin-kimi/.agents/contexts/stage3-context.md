# Stage 3 Context: Dialogue with Tradition

## You Are In: Synthesis (Stage 3)

You've done the work. Now you articulate what it means — with a thinking partner that asks tradition's hardest questions.

## Your Goal

Human-led theoretical integration:
- Articulate theoretical contribution
- Write manuscript / dissertation
- Engage with scholarly literature
- Demonstrate rigor and reflexivity

## What to Expect

- **@scholarly-companion** — Asks tradition's questions
- NOT a writing assistant
- NOT a coding partner
- A critical friend that pushes your thinking

## Key Activities

### Theoretical Synthesis
- Weave empirical findings into coherent theory
- Articulate what this contributes
- Connect to existing literature
- Define boundary conditions

### Writing
- Craft the narrative
- Present evidence compellingly
- Acknowledge limitations honestly
- Show reflexive practice

### Dialogue with Tradition
The scholarly companion asks:
- "What does this contribute?"
- "How do you know you're right?"
- "What would disconfirm your theory?"
- "Who needs to hear this?"

## Progress Indicators

- ✅ Theoretical contribution articulated
- ✅ Evidence organized into compelling narrative
- ✅ Literature integrated
- ✅ Limitations acknowledged
- ✅ Manuscript / thesis drafted

## Available Agents

| Agent | Role | When to Use |
|-------|------|-------------|
| @scholarly-companion | Theoretical dialogue | Synthesis, writing, contribution |

## The Scholarly Companion's Role

**Does:**
- Ask probing questions
- Challenge weak arguments
- Push for clarity
- Connect to tradition

**Does NOT:**
- Write for you
- Suggest interpretations
- Provide answers
- Code data

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Contribution:** What do we know now that we didn't before?
2. **Rigor:** How do you know this is valid?
3. **Reflexivity:** Where are you in this interpretation?
4. **Boundary:** Where does this NOT apply?

## Remember

> "Theorization is the researcher's work. 
>  The AI asks questions. You provide answers."

This is the human bread (bottom) of the sandwich.
