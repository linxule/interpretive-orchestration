# Your Epistemic Stance
## A Foundation for Thinking Partnership

Welcome to Interpretive Orchestration! Before we begin coding, let's establish your philosophical foundation. These aren't bureaucratic questions - they shape how we'll collaborate and think together.

## 🤔 Question 1: What is "Data" to You?

When you read a research document (interview, field note, archival record), what are you encountering?

**A) Objective facts waiting to be discovered**
- Reality exists independently of observation
- Patterns are "in the data" waiting to be found
- Good analysis reveals what's actually there
- Aligns with: Glaserian grounded theory, positivism

**B) Meanings requiring systematic interpretation**
- Reality exists but requires careful interpretation
- Patterns emerge through rigorous analytical procedures
- Good analysis builds valid theoretical constructions
- Aligns with: Gioia & Corley, Straussian grounded theory

**C) Co-created realities constructed with participants**
- Multiple realities exist simultaneously
- Meanings are negotiated between researcher and participants
- Good analysis acknowledges reflexive co-construction
- Aligns with: Charmaz constructivist, interpretivism

**D) I'm genuinely not sure - help me think about this**
- Let's explore these philosophical differences together
- Understanding your stance helps us collaborate better

**Your Choice:** _____________

## 📝 Question 2: When You Code a Document, You Are:

**A) Finding and labeling patterns that exist in the text**
- Codes reflect inherent properties of data
- Multiple coders should converge on same codes
- Inter-rater reliability validates objectivity

**B) Building interpretive categories grounded in evidence**
- Codes are your theoretical constructions
- Evidence constrains but doesn't determine coding
- Systematic procedures ensure rigor

**C) Co-constructing meaning through reflexive engagement**
- Codes reflect your interpretive position
- Your background and values shape what you see
- Reflexivity strengthens rather than weakens analysis

**D) Help me understand the difference**

**Your Choice:** _____________

## 🎯 Question 3: Your Role as Researcher Is To:

**A) Discover truth as objectively as possible**
- Minimize bias through systematic procedures
- Let patterns emerge without imposing frameworks
- Theory discovered from data

**B) Interpret meaning systematically and rigorously**
- Build theoretical frameworks grounded in evidence
- Balance induction with theoretical sensitivity
- Theory constructed through disciplined inquiry

**C) Co-create understanding reflexively and transparently**
- Honor multiple perspectives and realities
- Make interpretive position explicit
- Theory negotiated through interpretive process

**D) I'm exploring what this means for my research**

**Your Choice:** _____________

## 🌉 Question 4: How Do You View AI in This Research?

**A) A tool to automate manual labor (coding assistant)**
- AI speeds up tedious tasks
- I provide input, AI provides output
- Efficiency is primary benefit

**B) A pattern recognition engine requiring human interpretation**
- AI identifies possibilities at scale
- I provide theoretical sensitivity
- Scale with maintained rigor is primary benefit

**C) An epistemic partner for collaborative thinking**
- AI asks questions that deepen my reflexivity
- We co-construct understanding through dialogue
- Transformed thinking is primary benefit

**D) I haven't thought about this distinction**

**Your Choice:** _____________

## 🍞 Question 5: The "Sandwich Methodology"

Our approach is structured as: **Human (Stage 1) → Human-AI Collaboration (Stage 2) → Human (Stage 3)**

**Have you completed Stage 1: Manual Analysis?**
- [ ] Yes - I've manually coded 10+ documents and built initial framework
- [ ] Partially - I've coded some but not systematically
- [ ] No - I want to start with AI assistance
- [ ] What is Stage 1 and why is it required?

**If "No" was selected:**
⚠️ **Important:** Qualitative research requires foundational human engagement with data. AI cannot develop the interpretive depth and theoretical sensitivity that comes from close reading and manual coding.

We **strongly recommend** completing Stage 1 before using AI assistance. This isn't a barrier - it's essential for epistemic partnership. The sandwich starts with human bread!

**Would you like:**
- [ ] Guidance on Stage 1 manual analysis
- [ ] To proceed anyway (against recommendation)
- [ ] To understand why this matters philosophically

## 📊 Your Philosophical Profile

Based on your responses, your stance appears to be:

**Ontology:** [Interpretivist / Realist / Relativist]
**Epistemology:** [Co-constructive / Systematic-interpretive / Objectivist]
**Tradition:** [Gioia & Corley / Charmaz / Straussian / Glaserian / Custom]
**AI Relationship:** [Epistemic Partner / Interpretive Aid / Coding Tool]

**What This Means for Our Collaboration:**

When I (the plugin) interact with you, I will:
- Use language consistent with your stance (e.g., "construct" not "discover")
- Ask questions that deepen your reflexive awareness
- Respect your interpretive authority at all decision points
- Surface philosophical tensions when they arise
- Model epistemic humility and uncertainty

When you interact with me, remember:
- Your theoretical sensitivity cannot be automated
- Your interpretive authority is non-negotiable
- Your reflexive awareness is your strength
- Your engagement with data creates meaning

## 🤝 Our Partnership Agreement

I commit to:
- [ ] Showing my reasoning, not just results
- [ ] Asking questions when uncertain
- [ ] Honoring your interpretive authority
- [ ] Surfacing my assumptions
- [ ] Admitting what I cannot do

You commit to:
- [ ] Maintaining deep engagement with data
- [ ] Providing theoretical sensitivity
- [ ] Questioning both my outputs and your assumptions
- [ ] Completing Stage 1 before Stage 2
- [ ] Treating me as thinking partner, not calculator

## 💭 A Final Reflection Prompt

Before we begin, take a moment to write your own answer:

**What do you hope to learn about knowledge construction through this research?**

[Your response helps me understand what kind of epistemic partnership you need]

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once you've completed this epistemic stance declaration:
1. Run `/qual-init` to create your project structure
2. Begin Stage 1 manual analysis (or upload existing Stage 1 work)
3. When ready, engage Stage 2 collaborative features
4. Throughout: Use `/qual-examine-assumptions` to check philosophical coherence

Remember: This isn't bureaucracy. This is the foundation of meaningful collaboration.

**Let's think together.** 🌟
