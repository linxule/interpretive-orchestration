## 🌟 The Transformation

**What you might expect:**
"Software that automates qualitative coding so I can finish faster"

**What you'll actually get:**
"A thinking partner that deepens my reflexivity, challenges my assumptions, and helps me understand how I construct knowledge - making me a better researcher"

**The difference matters.**

---

## 🧠 What Is This Really?

This isn't another CAQDAS tool (NVivo, Atlas.ti, etc.) with AI bolted on.
This isn't ChatGPT for ad-hoc document analysis.
This isn't Google's AI Co-Scientist for qualitative research.

**This is infrastructure for human-AI epistemic partnership in interpretive inquiry.**

### What That Means

**Traditional tools:**
- You input data → AI processes → You review output
- AI automates manual labor (the "calculator mindset")
- Faster but not necessarily deeper
- Philosophy implicit and unexamined

**Epistemic partnership:**
- You build foundation → You + AI collaborate → You synthesize theory
- AI asks questions that deepen YOUR reflexivity
- Scale AND interpretive depth
- Philosophy explicit and reflexive

**The goal:** Transform how you think about interpretation itself, not just speed up coding.

## 🎨 The Atelier of Co-Apprenticeship

**Both human and AI are apprentices to the craft tradition of interpretive inquiry.** Neither masters the other. Both learn from craft principles: rigor, reflexivity, theoretical sensitivity, interpretive depth.

*Also known as human-AI-human "sandwich" from our original research.*

| Stage | What Happens | AI Role |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **1. Solo Practice** 🎨 | Manual coding of 10-15 docs, memo-writing, framework development | Watches but doesn't intervene (theoretical sensitivity can't be automated) |
| **2. Collaboration** 🤝 | Parallel streams (theoretical + empirical), synthesis, pattern characterization | 4-stage visible reasoning with @dialogical-coder |
| **3. Tradition Dialogue** 💭 | Examine work through craft tradition's wisdom | @scholarly-companion asks tradition's questions |

**The atelier ENFORCES Stage 1** - doors to collaborative workspace stay locked until solo practice complete.

## 🌊 Partnership Agency (Our Argument)

This plugin instantiates **Partnership Agency** from [Cognitio Emergens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03105) (Lin, 2025): "Human and AI boundaries dissolve into unified epistemic system generating insights neither could produce independently."

**Four enabling conditions:**
1. **Theoretical Foundation** - Stage 1 prevents calculator mindset
2. **Visible Reasoning** - 4-stage process prevents black-box opacity
3. **Recursive Evolution** - Both human and AI learn and adapt
4. **Epistemic Ambidexterity** - Balance AI capability with human control

**Our structure isn't constraint - it's architecture for Partnership Agency.** We provide ONE rigorous path, grounded in Cognitio Emergens and Gioia/Constructivist tradition.

## 🎯 Core Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Epistemic Coherence** | Plugin adapts to YOUR declared philosophy (ontology, epistemology, GT tradition) |
| **Reflexivity as Strength** | Prompts examine assumptions - awareness, not doubt |
| **Human Authority** | AI organizes and suggests; YOU interpret and decide (non-negotiable) |
| **Visible Reasoning** | 4-stage dialogical process shows HOW AI interpreted, not just WHAT |
| **Meta-Cognition** | Every interaction teaches you to think about thinking |
| **Progressive Depth** | Philosophy deepens through practice, not front-loaded lectures |

---

## 💡 What Makes This Different

| Approach | Their Model | Our Model |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| **vs CAQDAS** | AI bolted onto manual tools | AI embedded with human authority maintained |
| **vs ChatGPT** | Ad-hoc prompts, no audit trail | Systematic 4-stage dialogical process |
| **vs AI Co-Scientist** | Full automation (STEM) | Human-centered augmentation (Social Science) |

**Unique:** First infrastructure treating epistemology as UX design - embeds meta-cognition, enforces sandwich methodology, bundles MCP ecosystem.

---

## 🌊 Why This Tool Feels Different

This plugin prioritizes **friction over flow**. If it stops you, it's asking you to think.

| Trade-off | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Transformation over reliability** | Change how you think, not just process faster |
| **Dialogue over determinism** | Socratic onboarding adapts to YOU |
| **Reflection over efficiency** | Interpretive pauses are methodology, not bugs |

If something feels "heavy" - that's intentional epistemic friction preventing the "calculator mindset."

## 🚀 Getting Started

**New to Claude Code?** See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for complete hand-holding setup instructions (Windows, macOS, Linux).

**Want a pre-configured environment?** Use the [Starter Project](https://github.com/linxule/interpretive-orchestration-starter) - a ready-to-use VS Code workspace with beginner-friendly settings.

**Already have Claude Code?**
```bash
cd your-project-folder
claude
/plugin install linxule/interpretive-orchestration
/qual-check-setup  # Verify installation
/qual-init         # Begin Socratic onboarding
```

**Then:** Complete Stage 1 manual coding (10-15 documents) before AI-assisted analysis. This builds the irreplaceable theoretical sensitivity that makes partnership meaningful.

## 🔒 Methodology Hooks

The plugin enforces the sandwich methodology through automated hooks:

- **PreStage2** - Blocks AI coding until Stage 1 foundation complete
- **PostFiveDocuments** - Triggers interpretive pause every 5 documents
- **EpistemicCoherence** - Checks philosophical consistency

If you're blocked, it's asking you to think. That's intentional epistemic friction.

---

## 🎓 Pedagogical Approach

| Phase | Focus | AI Role |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Foundation** (Week 1) | Socratic onboarding, Stage 1 manual coding | Watches, doesn't intervene |
| **Deepening** (Week 4) | Stage 2 collaboration with @dialogical-coder | 4-stage visible reasoning |
| **Partnership** (Week 12) | Stage 3 synthesis, meta-dialogue | Asks tradition's questions |

**Philosophy deepens through practice**, not front-loaded lectures.

## 🔬 Methodological Foundation

This plugin implements methodology from published research:

**Source:** "Appendix A: Methodological Details" and "Method" sections from possibilistic narratives study

**Key Innovations:**
1. **Parallel discovery streams** (theoretical + empirical with mutual checking)
2. **Dialogical prompting** (4-stage visible reasoning prevents shallow coding)
3. **Interpretive pauses** (after every 5 documents, at transitions, for edge cases)
4. **Pattern characterization** (systematic variation analysis, not essentialist discovery)
5. **Multi-model triangulation** (prevents single-AI bias)
6. **Sandwich architecture** (human foundation → collaboration → human synthesis)

**Philosophical basis:**
- Gioia & Corley systematic interpretivist approach (default)
- Charmaz constructivist reflexivity
- Configurable for other coherent traditions

---

## 🌍 For Whom?

**Perfect for:** Qualitative researchers (GT, phenomenology, narrative analysis) who want scale AND interpretive depth

**Not for:** Those seeking pure automation or unwilling to engage philosophical foundations

---

## 🎬 Quick Demo

```bash
/qual-init                    # Socratic dialogue establishes your philosophy
/qual-status                  # Shows Stage 1 progress
@dialogical-coder Code R01    # 4-stage reflexive coding after Stage 1 complete
/qual-think-through           # Sequential Thinking for deep analysis
/qual-wisdom-check            # Lotus Wisdom for paradox navigation
```

---

## 🏗️ What Gets Built

├── stage2-collaboration/        # 🤝 Human-AI filling
└── stage3-synthesis/            # 🍞 Human bread (bottom)
```

**The folder structure teaches the methodology.**

**Note:** The plugin is ~90% markdown prompts, ~10% JavaScript hooks. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for technical details.

---

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: Why can't I skip Stage 1?**
A: AI cannot develop YOUR theoretical sensitivity. Manual engagement creates the foundation that makes Stage 2 collaboration meaningful.

**Q: What if I disagree with the AI?**
A: Perfect! The AI organizes possibilities; YOU make interpretive judgments. Your authority is non-negotiable.

**Q: Is this different from automation?**
A: Fundamentally. Automation replaces human labor. Partnership augments human thinking through reflexive dialogue.
