## The Three Stages

| Stage | You Do | Tools Available |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **Stage 1: Solo Practice** | Manual coding, memos | @stage1-listener, /qual-think-through |
| **Stage 2: Collaboration** | Guide AI, refine patterns | @dialogical-coder, @research-configurator |
| **Stage 3: Dialogue** | Interpret significance | @scholarly-companion |

## Key Commands

```bash
/qual-init                # Start: Socratic onboarding
/qual-status              # Check: Where am I in the journey?
/qual-check-setup         # Verify: Is everything configured?
/qual-configure-analysis  # Setup: Model and batch configuration
/qual-reflect             # Synthesize: End-of-session dialogue
/qual-think-through       # Deep: Structured reasoning (Sequential Thinking)
/qual-wisdom-check        # Navigate: Paradox integration (Lotus Wisdom)
/qual-examine-assumptions # Meta: Check philosophical coherence
```
