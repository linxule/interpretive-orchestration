## Why MIT License?

**Epistemic infrastructure should be freely available.**

We chose MIT because:
- Maximum freedom for researchers to use, modify, adapt
- Compatible with academic and commercial use
- Simple and permissive
- Encourages community extension and innovation

**Philosophy:** Knowledge construction tools should be accessible to all.

**We ask only:**
- Maintain philosophical coherence in extensions
- Cite the methods paper when using in research
- Share improvements back with community (encouraged, not required)

**Open source for open inquiry.** 🌟
