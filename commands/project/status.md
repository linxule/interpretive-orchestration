## Readiness Signals

### Stage 1 → Stage 2 Transition

**You're ready when:**
- ✓ 10-15 documents manually coded (minimum)
- ✓ Initial data structure with clear concept definitions
- ✓ 5+ analytical memos written
- ✓ You can articulate YOUR theoretical sensitivity
- ✓ You feel interpretive foundation is established

**How to know:**
> "I have a feel for my data. I know what patterns matter to ME.
> I can distinguish between superficial and theoretically significant.
> I have categories that emerged from MY engagement."

**Not ready if:**
- You're still discovering what your data is about
- Concepts feel vague or unclear
- You're uncertain about theoretical boundaries
- You haven't written memos about emerging insights

**Guidance:** Don't rush! Stage 1 depth is irreplaceable.

### Stage 2 → Stage 3 Transition

**You're ready when:**
- ✓ All (or most) documents coded
- ✓ Data structure refined through feedback rounds
- ✓ Pattern characterization complete (if applicable)
- ✓ You have AI-organized evidence tables
- ✓ You're ready to THEORIZE (not just organize)

**How to know:**
> "I have all the organized evidence I need. Now I need to
> construct theoretical meaning, integrate with literature,
> and articulate my contribution."

**Not ready if:**
- Still discovering new patterns
- Framework feels unstable
- More documents would add theoretical insight
- Haven't achieved theoretical saturation

---

## Next Steps (Context-Aware Guidance)

**Based on your current position {STAGE, PHASE}, here's what comes next:**

### If in Stage 1:
```
Continue building your interpretive foundation:
• Code more documents until patterns stabilize
• Write memos about emerging insights
• Consult theoretical literature
• Build/refine your initial framework

Available tools:
• /qual-think-through (plan your analytical approach)
• /qual-examine-assumptions (check your philosophical stance)
• /qual-memo (capture analytical insights)

When ready: /qual-init will validate Stage 1 completion
```

### If in Stage 2, Phase 2:
```
You're in collaborative coding. Partnership in action!
• Continue with @dialogical-coder for document coding
• Provide theoretical guidance when AI is uncertain
• Regular reflexive pauses with /qual-reflect
• Document insights in memos

Available tools:
• @dialogical-coder (4-stage reflexive coding)
• /qual-reflect (synthesis dialogue)
• /qual-think-through (deep reasoning)
• /qual-wisdom-check (navigate paradoxes)
• /qual-get-perspectives (multi-model validation)

Next milestone: Complete document coding, move to Phase 3
```

### If approaching Stage 3:
```
Prepare for human-led synthesis and theorization:
• Review all AI-organized evidence
• Begin theoretical integration
• Connect findings to literature
• Construct final framework

Remember: Stage 3 is YOUR interpretive work.
AI has organized evidence. Now YOU construct meaning.

Available tools:
• /qual-reflect (prepare for synthesis)
• /qual-think-through (build theoretical framework)
• /qual-wisdom-check (integrate diverse findings)

This is where your Stage 1 depth becomes theory!
```

## Context-Agnostic Design

This dashboard works for:
- Healthcare research (patient experiences)
- Educational studies (learning processes)
- Organizational research (leadership practices)
- Consumer research (decision-making)
- **ANY qualitative inquiry**

**The STRUCTURE of progress visualization transfers.**
**The CONTENT of what's being analyzed is yours.** 🌟
