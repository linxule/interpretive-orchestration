# Stage 1 Commands: Why This Folder Exists (And Why It's Intentionally Minimal)

## The Philosophy of This Folder

You might notice: **This folder has very few (or no) command files.**

**This is intentional, not oversight.**

---

## 🍞 Stage 1 is Human-Led

**Core Principle:** Stage 1 requires YOUR deep, unmediated engagement with data.

**What Stage 1 involves:**
- Close reading of documents
- Manual open coding
- Axial coding and grouping
- Theoretical memo-writing
- Initial framework development
- Building theoretical sensitivity

**Why minimal AI assistance:**
- This is where YOU develop interpretive depth
- AI cannot create YOUR theoretical sensitivity
- Manual engagement generates insights AI cannot provide
- This foundation makes Stage 2 partnership meaningful

**The sandwich starts with human bread!** 🍞

## What Tools ARE Available for Stage 1

### Thinking Partner
- **@stage1-listener** - Your "rubber duck" for manual coding
  - Asks questions to help you articulate what you're seeing
  - Reflects back your thinking without interpreting for you
  - Prompts memo-writing when insights emerge
  - **NEVER suggests codes or patterns** - that's your job

### Thinking Support (Not Coding Automation)
- `/qual-think-through` - Plan your Stage 1 approach systematically
- `/qual-examine-assumptions` - Surface your philosophical commitments
- `/qual-status` - See your progress and stay oriented

### Documentation
- `/qual-memo` - Capture analytical insights (coming in Phase 2)
- Manual note-taking in `stage1-foundation/memos/`

### Philosophical Guidance
- `skills/project-setup/templates/epistemic-stance.md` - Your declared philosophy
- `skills/gioia-methodology/templates/gioia-structure-guide.md` - How to build your framework

## What Tools Are NOT Available (By Design)

### ❌ @dialogical-coder
**Why blocked:** Would bypass the manual engagement that builds depth

### ❌ Automated coding commands
**Why blocked:** Stage 1 IS the manual work

### ❌ AI pattern extraction
**Why blocked:** YOU must identify patterns through YOUR engagement

---

## How to Complete Stage 1

### 1. Sample Your Data
- 10-15 documents (purposeful diversity)
- Use `/qual-think-through` to plan sampling strategy

### 2. Code Manually
- Stay close to participant language (informant-centric)
- Build 1st-order concepts from their terms
- Don't worry about perfection - patterns will emerge

### 3. Write Memos
- Document emerging insights
- Question your assumptions
- Connect to theory
- Save in `stage1-foundation/memos/`

### 4. Build Initial Framework
- Group 1st-order codes into 2nd-order themes
- Develop preliminary aggregate dimensions
- Use `skills/gioia-methodology/templates/gioia-data-structure-template.json`
- Save to `stage1-foundation/initial-structure.json`

### 5. Check Readiness
When you feel:
> "I have a sense of my data. I know what patterns matter to ME.
> I can distinguish superficial from theoretically significant.
> I have categories that emerged from my engagement."

**Then:** Run `/qual-status` - it will validate Stage 1 completion

## Why We Don't Provide More Commands Here

**Because:**
- Commands imply AI automation
- Stage 1 must be human-led for epistemic reasons
- The best "tool" for Stage 1 is **your close reading and reflexive thinking**

**This isn't gatekeeping - it's epistemology.**

AI cannot develop YOUR theoretical sensitivity.
This stage is where you become the expert on your data.
Don't rush it. Don't shortcut it.

**The depth you build here makes everything else possible.** 🌱

## When You're Done with Stage 1

Run `/qual-status` to validate completion, then:

**Stage 2 unlocks:**
- @dialogical-coder (4-stage reflexive coding)
- Parallel discovery streams
- Synthesis tools
- Full AI collaboration

**But Stage 2 works BECAUSE Stage 1 gave you:**
- Theoretical sensitivity AI lacks
- Interpretive foundation for evaluating AI outputs
- Conceptual framework AI applies
- Authority to guide AI's work

**This is why Stage 1 matters.** 💡

---

*This folder stays minimal because Stage 1 is about YOUR engagement, not our tools.*

**Go read your data. Code it yourself. Write memos. Think.**

That's Stage 1. 📚
