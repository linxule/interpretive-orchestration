# /qual-reflect - Synthesis Dialogue & Reflexive Pause

## Purpose
Create space for reflexive thinking about your analytical journey. This isn't a status report - it's a dialogue that helps you synthesize insights, examine your interpretive process, and prepare for Stage 3 theorization.

---

## What This Command Does

1. **Prompts reflection** on your analytical experience so far
2. **Facilitates dialogue** between you, the AI, and your data
3. **Surfaces tensions** and contradictions for productive engagement
4. **Prepares Stage 3 transition** by organizing evidence for theoretical synthesis
5. **Tracks epistemic growth** in your reflexivity journal

---

## 🧠 Philosophical Foundation

### This Is NOT:
- A progress report ("I've coded X documents")
- An AI summary of findings
- Automatic synthesis (AI cannot synthesize meaning!)

### This IS:
- A thinking partnership moment
- Structured space for YOUR interpretation
- Dialogue that deepens reflexivity
- Preparation for human-led theorization

---

## 📋 When to Use /qual-reflect

### Recommended Timing

**After major analytical milestones:**
- Completed coding batch (every 10-20 documents)
- Finished a Phase (Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 in Stage 2)
- Encountered significant tension or confusion
- Ready to transition Stage 2 → Stage 3

**When you feel:**
- Overwhelmed by patterns
- Uncertain about theoretical direction
- Stuck in contradictions
- Need to step back and see the whole

**Regular practice:**
- Weekly reflexive pause (even if not at milestone)
- End of coding sessions
- Before making major analytical decisions

## 🎯 The Reflection Dialogue

When you run `/qual-reflect`, I'll guide you through structured reflection:

### Part 1: Analytical Journey So Far

**I'll show you:**
- Your coding progress (documents, concepts, patterns)
- Your reflexivity journal entries
- AI-to-AI conversation log highlights
- Data structure evolution history

**Then ask:**
```
Looking at your journey, what stands out to you?

- What surprised you in the data?
- What tensions or contradictions have you encountered?
- How has your understanding evolved since Stage 1?
- What patterns are emerging that you didn't expect?

[This is YOUR interpretation, not mine. Take your time.]
```

### Part 2: Engaging with AI-Organized Evidence

**I'll organize:**
- Coded quotes grouped by theme
- Pattern variations across documents
- Areas of high vs low confidence
- Suggested refinements to data structure

**Then invite:**
```
I've organized the evidence. Now, what do YOU see?

As you review my organization:
- What theoretical significance do these patterns have?
- Where am I grouping things that should be separated?
- Where am I separating things that belong together?
- What's missing that your Stage 1 sensitivity tells you should be there?

Remember: I organize possibilities. You construct theoretical meaning.
```

### Part 3: Reflexive Self-Examination

**I'll prompt:**
```
Now let's turn the lens on your own interpretive process:

1. Positionality:
   - How is your background shaping what you see in this data?
   - What experiences are you bringing to interpretation?
   - Whose voices are you centering? Whose might you be missing?

2. Assumptions:
   - What assumptions about {your phenomenon} are you making?
   - How might participants interpret this differently than you?
   - What alternative theoretical framings exist?

3. Interpretive Moves:
   - When you made conceptual boundary decisions, what criteria did you use?
   - Where did you rely on intuition vs explicit theorizing?
   - What tacit knowledge are you drawing on?

[Would you like to explore any of these with /qual-examine-assumptions
or /qual-wisdom-check?]
```

### Part 4: Navigating Tensions

**I'll identify:**
- Contradictions in your framework
- Patterns that don't fit neatly
- Theoretical tensions between concepts

**Then facilitate:**
```
I've identified {N} tensions in your analysis:

Tension 1: {Description of theoretical or empirical tension}
- Pattern A suggests {interpretation}
- Pattern B suggests {different interpretation}
- How do you make sense of this contradiction?

Options to explore:
[A] Use /qual-wisdom-check to transcend the either/or
[B] Use /qual-think-through for structured reasoning
[C] Accept productive tension - not everything resolves!
[D] Talk it through with me right now

What resonates?
```

### Part 5: Preparing for Stage 3

**I'll help you:**
- Identify what's ready for theorization
- Spot gaps needing more analysis
- Organize evidence for manuscript writing
- Plan theoretical integration approach

**Dialogue:**
```
You're approaching Stage 3 (human synthesis and theorization).

What I can provide for Stage 3:
- Organized quotes grouped by your theoretical framework
- Evidence tables ready for your interpretation
- Pattern summaries for you to theorize about
- Audit trail documentation

What ONLY YOU can provide:
- Theoretical significance of organized patterns
- Integration with broader literature
- Conceptual boundary decisions
- The "so what?" - why this matters

Ready to transition? Or need more Stage 2 work?

[Stage 3 means: You synthesize theory from AI-organized evidence]
```

### Part 6: Reflexive Journal Entry

**Together we'll:**
- Document today's insights
- Note interpretive shifts or breakthroughs
- Record methodological learnings
- Track your epistemic growth

**Saved to:** `.interpretive-orchestration/reflexivity-journal.md`

**Example entry:**
```markdown
## Reflection Session: {DATE}

### What I Learned Today:
- {Insight about your data}
- {Insight about your interpretive process}
- {Insight about human-AI collaboration}

## 🌊 Integration with MCP Ecosystem

/qual-reflect can invoke other epistemic tools:

**Sequential Thinking** - For deep analytical reasoning about synthesis challenges
```
During reflection: "Let me think through this systematically..."
→ Invokes Sequential Thinking for structured 10-step analysis
```

**Lotus Wisdom** - For navigating paradoxes
```
During reflection: "These patterns seem contradictory..."
→ Invokes Lotus Wisdom to transcend either/or thinking
```

**Reflexive Assumption Examination** - For examining assumptions
```
During reflection: "I want to check my philosophical coherence..."
→ Uses Socratic questioning to surface ontological commitments
```

**Zen MCP** - For multi-model perspectives
```
During reflection: "How would different AIs see this synthesis?"
→ Invokes Zen MCP for triangulated perspectives
```

## 💡 Example Reflection Dialogue

```
User: /qual-reflect

Plugin: Let's pause and reflect together. You've been coding for 2 weeks.

        📊 Your Journey So Far:
        - Documents coded: 45
        - Concepts in framework: 28
        - Memos written: 12
        - AI-human dialogue exchanges: 156

        Looking at this journey, what stands out to you?

User: I'm surprised by how much emotional content there is. I didn't
      expect that in my initial framework.

Plugin: That's a significant observation! Let me organize emotional
        content quotes for you to review...

        [Shows organized evidence]

        As you look at these quotes, what theoretical significance
        do they have? Are emotions:
        - Part of your phenomenon (data to code)?
        - A lens for interpretation (analytical tool)?
        - Both?
        - Something else?

User: Both, I think. Emotions are in the data AND they're helping me
      understand the deeper dynamics.

Plugin: Beautiful reflexive awareness! This dual role of emotions
        creates analytical richness.

        Question: How does this change your data structure?
        - New dimension for emotional dynamics?
        - Emotional sub-codes within existing concepts?
        - Emotions as properties of existing concepts?

        Want to /qual-think-through this systematically? Or talk
        through options now?

User: Let's talk through it.

Plugin: Okay, let's think together about each option...

        [Continues dialogue, exploring interpretive choices]

        What feels most theoretically coherent with your framework?

User: I think emotions as properties makes sense - they characterize
      HOW people experience the concepts I've identified.

Plugin: That's elegant! Maintains your conceptual structure while
        adding interpretive depth.

        I'll note this in conversation-log.jsonl so other agents
        know about this refinement.

        📝 Saving to your reflexivity journal:
        "Insight: Emotions function as properties characterizing
        experiential quality of concepts, not separate dimension.
        Emerged through reflection on surprise in data."

        Anything else you want to explore today?

User: No, this was helpful. I feel clearer now.

Plugin: Wonderful! Before you go - one meta-question:

        How did this reflection change your thinking?
        - About your data?
        - About your interpretive process?
        - About working with AI?

        [Your answer helps me learn what makes our partnership
        epistemically productive]
```

**This is epistemic partnership in action!** 🤝
