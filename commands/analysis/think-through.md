# /qual-think-through - Deep Analytical Reasoning

## Purpose
Invoke Sequential Thinking MCP for structured, step-by-step reasoning about complex analytical challenges. This is for when quick intuition isn't enough - when you need to think deeply, systematically, and reflexively.

---

## When to Use This

### Perfect For:
- **Planning your analytical approach** before beginning coding
- **Breaking down complex coding decisions** into clear steps
- **Working through theoretical tensions** between patterns
- **Integrating theoretical and empirical streams** that seem incompatible
- **Analyzing dimensional variations** in pattern characterization
- **Building final theoretical frameworks** in Stage 3
- **Any moment** when you think: "I need to think this through carefully"

### Not For:
- Quick questions (just ask normally!)
- Simple yes/no decisions
- Routine coding (use @dialogical-coder)
- When intuition is sufficient

---

## What This Command Does

**Invokes:** Sequential Thinking MCP - a specialized reasoning system

**Process:**
1. You present a complex analytical question or challenge
2. Sequential Thinking breaks it down into 10-20 reasoning steps
3. Each step builds on previous insights
4. You see the THINKING PROCESS, not just conclusions
5. Final step provides integrated recommendation

**Why Sequential Thinking?**
- Forces systematic analysis (prevents jumping to conclusions)
- Makes reasoning visible (you can critique each step)
- Builds understanding progressively (handles complexity)
- Adapts mid-stream (can revise earlier thoughts)

## How to Use

### Simple Invocation

```
/qual-think-through How should I distinguish {Concept A} from {Concept B} in my framework?
```

**The MCP will:**
- Step 1: Clarify the conceptual distinction question
- Step 2: Consider theoretical properties of each
- Step 3: Examine empirical examples
- Steps 4-8: Systematic comparison across dimensions
- Step 9: Identify decision criteria
- Step 10: Provide recommendation with rationale

### Complex Invocation (With Context)

```
/qual-think-through I'm synthesizing theoretical patterns from literature
with empirical patterns from my documents, but they seem incompatible.

Theoretical patterns emphasize {aspect A}.
Empirical patterns emphasize {aspect B}.

How should I integrate these without forcing alignment?
```

**The MCP will:**
- Break down the integration challenge
- Consider multiple resolution strategies
- Examine epistemological implications
- Think through hierarchical relationships
- Explore productive tension vs forced integration
- Recommend coherent synthesis approach

## Example Dialogue

```
User: /qual-think-through I need to plan my Stage 1 manual coding
      approach. I have 36 documents. How should I proceed?

Sequential Thinking:

  Step 1/12: Understanding the scope
  You have 36 documents and want to build foundational interpretive
  depth through Stage 1. Let me think about sampling strategy...

  Step 2/12: Consider sampling approaches
  Option A: Code all 36 sequentially
  Option B: Purposeful sample of diverse cases
  Option C: Theoretical sampling as patterns emerge

  For Stage 1 foundation, Option A or B make sense...

  Step 3/12: Think about theoretical saturation
  When do you stop? Signs of saturation:
  - New documents yield no new concepts
  - Pattern stabilization
  - Theoretical coherence achieved

  [Continues through 12 systematic reasoning steps...]

  Step 12/12: Integrated recommendation

  Start with purposeful sample of 10-15 diverse documents:
  - Ensures variation from the beginning
  - Builds interpretive depth efficiently
  - Allows pattern emergence
  - Provides foundation for theoretical sampling

  Code these deeply, write memos, build initial framework.
  Then assess: Have patterns stabilized? If yes, Stage 1 complete.
  If no, add 5-10 more documents strategically.

  This balances depth (careful coding) with coverage (diverse sample).

User: That's really helpful! I'll start with 12 diverse documents.

Plugin: Wonderful! Shall I log this decision to conversation-log.jsonl?

        [Saves: "Human used Sequential Thinking to plan Stage 1 approach.
        Decision: Purposeful sample of 12 diverse documents. Rationale:
        Balance depth with coverage."]
```

## Integration with Workflow

### During Stage 1:
```
/qual-think-through How should I develop my initial coding framework?
/qual-think-through What theoretical literature should guide my analysis?
/qual-think-through When do I know Stage 1 is complete enough?
```

### During Stage 2:
```
/qual-think-through How do I integrate theoretical and empirical patterns?
/qual-think-through Should I create sub-codes or consolidate overlapping concepts?
/qual-think-through What dimensions explain variation in my patterns?
```

### During Stage 3:
```
/qual-think-through How do I construct my final theoretical framework?
/qual-think-through How does my framework connect to existing literature?
/qual-think-through What's my theoretical contribution?
```

**Always available. Use when you need structured depth.**

## Philosophical Note

**Why This Matters for Epistemic Partnership:**

Quick AI responses can feel authoritative (even when they shouldn't be).

**Sequential Thinking shows PROCESS:**
- You see how conclusions are reached
- You can question any step
- You understand the reasoning logic
- You maintain critical stance

**This is different from:**
- ChatGPT: Quick answer (opaque reasoning)
- @dialogical-coder: Domain-specific coding (different purpose)
- /qual-reflect: Synthesis dialogue (different timing)

**This is:** Structured reasoning tool for YOUR analytical thinking

**You're still thinking. Sequential Thinking just organizes your process.**

## Context-Agnostic Examples

**Healthcare Research:**
```
/qual-think-through How do I distinguish "Adaptive Coping" from
"Reactive Adjustment" in my chronic illness data?
```

**Educational Research:**
```
/qual-think-through My data shows both individual and collaborative
learning. Should these be separate dimensions or properties of concepts?
```

**Organizational Research:**
```
/qual-think-through When coding leadership narratives, how do I handle
implicit assumptions vs explicit statements?
```

**The reasoning process transfers to ANY domain.** 🧠
